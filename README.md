# Eduexo Experiment (PC)

This project integrates a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) to train a neural network for classifying human intentions during experiments. Participants are asked to think about moving their arm up or down, and the EXO device either aids or contradicts their movement. EEG signals are recorded during these tasks, which are later used to classify the participant's intentions. This setup allows for precise control and monitoring of the experiment and communication with both EXO and computer which reads 'Events stream' in real time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Compatible hardware for data streaming (e.g., EXO device)
    - The EXO device must meet specific requirements for compatibility. Ensure that your device firmware is up-to-date and that it supports the necessary data streaming protocols. Refer to: [https://github.com/JakaHatlakLJ/eduexo_EEG]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd Eduexo_PC
```

2. Install all requriements from `requirements.txt` in your environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Hierarchy

The project directory is organized as follows. Once `experiment_do.py` is run for the first time with the default `experiment_config.json`, all subfolders will automatically be created and populated if not already.

## Setting Up the Experiment

Before running the `experiment_do.py` script, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Configure and setup EXO:**
    - Install all requirements on EXO and make sure you can run scripts on it.
    - Refer to: [https://github.com/JakaHatlakLJ/eduexo_EEG]

2. **Configure the Experiment:**
    - Open `experiment_config.json`.
    - Modify the configuration parameters as needed for your experiment.

## Running the Experiment

1. Once the setup is complete, you can run the experiment using the following command:
```sh
python experiment_do.py
```

2. Run `EXO_main.py` on EXO at the same time and follow the instructions. (If run for testing purposes you can additionaly use LSL_send_position.py on EXO)

3. If run with real decoding, another LSL stream of name "PredictionStream" is needed. For testing run the following script in a seperate terminal to mimic the real decoder:
```sh
python /testing_&_debugging/LSL_synthetic_predictions.py
```

This will start the experiment based on the configurations prepared in the previous steps.

## Additional Information

- Refer to the docstrings and comments within each script for more detailed instructions and explanations.
- The `requirements.txt` file should contain all the necessary Python packages needed to run the project.

### Additional Scripts:

   You can run other scripts for specific functionalities or testing as needed. For example, to test if "events_stream" is sending out correct data, use this in a seperate terminal:
   ```sh
   python LSL_read_events_stream.py
   ```
